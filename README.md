# tank-operator

Web frontend over a thin K8s orchestrator that spawns ephemeral agent pods on
demand. "+ button → fresh agent shell, terminal opens in a browser tab, killed when the tab
closes." See [issue #1](https://github.com/nelsong6/tank-operator/issues/1) for the full
design and rationale.

The Claude and Codex session images are both built from `claude-container/`
in this repo (`Dockerfile`, `mcp.json`, `entrypoint.sh`, bundled skills, plus
a bundled `platform-mcp/` MCP server). [claude-container-build.yml](.github/workflows/claude-container-build.yml)
pushes SHA-pinned `romainecr.azurecr.io/claude-container:<sha>` and
`romainecr.azurecr.io/codex-container:<sha>` images, then rewrites the Helm
chart to point each session mode at the right image.

The HTTP MCP servers it talks to also live here:

- `k8s-mcp-azure/` — Helm chart wrapping Microsoft's `azure-mcp` image, fronted by kube-rbac-proxy.
- `k8s-mcp-github/` + `mcp-servers/github/` — chart + Python source for a custom GitHub App-backed MCP server. Built by [mcp-github-build.yml](.github/workflows/mcp-github-build.yml).
- `k8s-mcp-k8s/` + `mcp-servers/k8s/` — chart + Python source for a read-only kubectl/helm MCP. Built by [mcp-k8s-build.yml](.github/workflows/mcp-k8s-build.yml).
- `k8s-mcp-argocd/` + `mcp-servers/argocd/` — chart + Python source for a read-only ArgoCD MCP that authenticates outbound via Dex SA-token exchange. Built by [mcp-argocd-build.yml](.github/workflows/mcp-argocd-build.yml).

Runtime UAMIs (e.g. `mcp.tf`, `mcp-server/`) live under `infra/`. CI auth
(image-push to ACR) for every workflow uses `vars.ARM_CLIENT_ID` — the
identity infra-bootstrap mints for tank-operator via
`module.app["tank-operator"]`. Shared cluster infrastructure (the AKS
cluster itself, the ACR, the Key Vault) also lives in
[infra-bootstrap](https://github.com/nelsong6/infra-bootstrap) and is
referenced here as data sources.

## Repo layout

```
backend/                      FastAPI + kubernetes-asyncio orchestrator
frontend/                     Vite + React UI (xterm.js arrives in Phase 2)
Dockerfile                    multi-stage: vite build → python runtime
k8s/                          Helm chart: deployment, RBAC, HTTPRoute, ExternalSecret
.github/workflows/build.yml   OIDC az login → build → push to ACR
```

## Phases

1. **Skeleton** (this commit) — orchestrator Deployment up; `POST /api/sessions` creates a
   Job; `GET`/`DELETE` work; frontend `+` button hits the API and lists sessions. No exec.
2. **Exec** — WebSocket proxy + xterm.js. End-to-end terminal in browser.
3. **Polish** — tab UI, sidebar, idle reaper, optional per-session PVC.

## Local dev

```bash
# Backend (needs a kube context with access to the sessions namespace, or run --dry-run)
cd backend && pip install -e . && python -m tank_operator

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev
# Vite dev server proxies /api → http://localhost:8000.
# Sign in via MSAL: the dev server uses the same Entra app registration as prod
# (redirect URI registered for https://tank.romaine.life/), so you'll need to
# either tunnel localhost behind that hostname or add a dev redirect URI.
```

## Deploy

ArgoCD auto-syncs `k8s/` when changes hit `main`. Image is built and pushed to
`romainecr.azurecr.io/tank-operator:<sha>` (and `:latest`) by `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

Auth: the SPA uses MSAL.js to obtain an Entra ID token, POSTs it to
`/api/auth/microsoft/login`, and the backend mints its own short-lived JWT
(see [auth.py](backend/src/tank_operator/auth.py)). Sessions are scoped by
SHA-256 of the signed-in user's email. Allowlist is the comma-separated
`ALLOWED_EMAILS` env var, sourced from KV via ExternalSecret.
