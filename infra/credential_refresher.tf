# Orchestrator credentials-seed UAMI — Azure side
# ============================================================================
# Provides the Azure identity the orchestrator uses to write the Anthropic
# OAuth blob to Key Vault from the in-app "+ config sub" / save-credentials
# flow (backend/src/tank_operator/credentials_seed.py). That break-glass
# harvest is now the sole consumer of this UAMI — steady-state rotation
# moved to the api-proxy's own UAMI (see infra/api_proxy.tf).
#
# (The "refresher" name is a hangover from prior designs: first a CronJob
# that owned this UAMI exclusively, then an in-process refresh loop in the
# orchestrator. Both are gone but the UAMI is reused as-is — the resource
# name is in K8s state and renaming it would force-replace the role
# assignment and the KV-published client_id for no functional benefit.)

# coupling apply order, and (b) this UAMI has no other Azure surface
# anyway, so vault-wide vs. secret-scoped is the same blast radius.
