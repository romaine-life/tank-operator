# Cosmos DB — profile store for multi-user (#57)
# ============================================================================
# Per-user profile rows live here, keyed by email. Each profile carries the
# user's GitHub App installation_id so mcp-github (#57 stage 3) can mint a
# per-caller installation token instead of every user sharing the host's.
#
# Why Cosmos and not Postgres: relational isn't load-bearing for the profile
# shape (one document per user, no joins) and Azure managed Postgres is
# overkill for the volume. Cosmos serverless gives pay-per-RU pricing that
# rounds to zero at this scale, no patch-window operations, and the same
# workload-identity auth path the orchestrator already uses for KV writes.
#
# Why reuse the credential_refresher UAMI instead of a dedicated one: that
# UAMI is already federated to the orchestrator SA and is the only Azure
# identity the orchestrator process holds. Adding a Cosmos role to it doesn't
# change the orchestrator's blast radius — the process is the trust boundary,
# not the UAMI. Same calculus as the existing KV role on this UAMI.
