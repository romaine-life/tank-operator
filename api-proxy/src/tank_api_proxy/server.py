"""Envoy ext_proc service that injects Anthropic OAuth into outbound requests.

The Envoy listener in front of api.anthropic.com calls this service via the
``ExternalProcessor.Process`` bidirectional stream once per HTTP transaction.
We act on two messages per stream:

  - ``request_headers``: if the inbound ``authorization`` header is the
    bootstrap placeholder ``Bearer managed-by-tank-operator``, swap it for
    the current real OAuth access token from cache. If it's anything else
    (typically a worker_jwt for the v2 remote-control bridge — see below),
    pass the request through untouched.
  - ``response_headers``: peek ``:status``. On 401 *for a request we
    actually injected into*, kick off a background refresh — but only if
    one isn't already in flight (single-flight guard prevents thundering-
    herd rotation storms when many concurrent requests all see 401).
    Envoy's per-route retry policy resends the request; the retry's
    request_headers callback awaits the in-flight refresh task before
    injecting, so the retry always sees a fresh token.

Why two distinct credentials in claude-code:
  * OAuth access token: long-lived (8h), pod-resident only as a placeholder,
    real value lives in this proxy's cache. Used for /v1/messages,
    /v1/code/sessions, /v1/code/sessions/{id}/bridge, /archive, /events,
    /api/oauth/*, /api/claude_code/*, etc.
  * worker_jwt: short-lived, returned by the /bridge POST response, kept
    only in claude-code memory. Used for the v2 remote-control bridge
    endpoints: GET /v1/code/sessions/{id}/worker, PUT same, GET
    /v1/code/sessions/{id}/worker/events/stream. These endpoints reject
    the OAuth Bearer outright with 401, so it's load-bearing that the
    proxy NOT clobber the Authorization on these calls.

State:
  - ``_cached_access`` / ``_cached_refresh``: in-memory copy of the latest
    tokens. Initialized lazily from the mounted credentials.json the first
    time we need them, refreshed in place by ``_refresh()``.
  - ``_refresh_task``: most recent refresh task. Its presence + not done()
    is the single-flight token; ``_get_access_token`` awaits it when
    ``_access_invalidated`` is set.
  - ``_lock``: serializes the actual rotation HTTP call so concurrent waiters
    all see the same fresh token (and so a stale-file reload in ``_refresh``
    is atomic with the rotate).

KV write failure is non-fatal: see the comment on ``_persist_to_kv``.

Anthropic-side gating gotcha (burned us during rollout verification):
api.anthropic.com's /v1/messages endpoint refuses subscription OAuth tokens
unless TWO request headers are set, and the error messages are misleading:

  - Without ``anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`` →
    401 "OAuth authentication is currently not supported" (it IS supported,
    just gated behind the beta opt-in).
  - Without ``anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`` →
    401 "Invalid authentication credentials" even on a freshly-minted token.

claude-code itself sends both headers natively, so traffic from session
pods works without this proxy adding them. We do NOT inject these here:
doing so would mask a future claude-code header change rather than
surfacing it. If you're synthetically curling api.anthropic.com to test
this proxy, set both headers; if a real claude-code session 401s when
synthetic curls succeed, the gate has moved and claude-code needs a bump.
The beta string above is hardcoded in claude-code's bundled JS as of
April 2026 — Anthropic rotating it would silently break direct callers
but not claude-code, which ships the matching value.
