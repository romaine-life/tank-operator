# Session Lifecycle Capabilities

This ledger names session lifecycle behavior that crosses browser,
orchestrator, database, and pod boundaries.

## SpireLens MCP Session Capability

Status: in progress

Intent:
Let a user opt a pod-backed session into the SpireLens game-host MCP without
making tailnet membership or host tools part of every Tank session.

Affected contracts:
- Session Lifecycle
- Auth And Streams
- Observability

Contract impact:
- Session creation must persist the selected capability in the session row and
  pod annotation so refresh, reconnect, and debugging do not depend on browser
  state.
- No-pod session modes must reject the capability because there is no pod
  lifecycle boundary where the tailnet join can occur.
- The session pod must join the tailnet with projected `auth.romaine.life`
  identity only; no static auth key or manual relay is allowed.
- The MCP listener must remain absent unless the session selected the capability
  and the deployment configured a host upstream.

Evidence:
- `backend-go/internal/sessionmodel/sessionmodel_test.go` covers capability
  normalization and SpireLens pod manifest wiring.
- `backend-go/internal/sessions/manager_test.go` covers manager admission,
  configured/unconfigured behavior, no-pod rejection, and pod annotations/env.
- `backend-go/cmd/tank-operator/session_pod_bootstrap_script_test.go` covers the
  opt-in bootstrap exchange chain and userspace `tailscaled` launch.
- `backend-go/cmd/tank-operator/handlers_session_list_events_test.go` and
  `frontend/src/sessionStore.test.ts` cover capabilities on the session row
  update wire.
- `claude-container/mcp-auth-proxy/tests/test_server.py` covers conditional
  SpireLens listener activation.
- `helm template tank-operator ./k8s` covers chart rendering of the deployment
  env and derived `mcp.spirelens.json` ConfigMap entry.
