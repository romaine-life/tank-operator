# tank-operator

Web frontend over a thin K8s orchestrator that spawns ephemeral session pods on demand. "+ button → fresh container, terminal opens in a browser tab, killed when the tab closes." See [README.md](README.md) for the layout.

## Product position

**The pod is the product**, not any specific agent UI. Pods ship pre-configured with private networking + an MCP gateway + (eventually) docs RAG; the user runs whatever agent they prefer inside it (Claude Code today because it's common, but Codex/Gemini/aider/`vim` should all work). North Star is "don't make users learn our system" — they bring their existing tooling into a pre-baked environment. Closest analog is Coder, with MCP-aware envs as the wedge no one else ships.

**Strategic purpose — LLMs-as-a-service.** Beyond personal use, the platform is designed to hand a hosted dev session to other people. Near-term: collaborate with friends without their own Claude Max subscription (gated by `ALLOWED_EMAIL`). Long-term: enterprise multi-tenant LLM delivery — same shape, with billing/quotas/tenancy. Design preserves this: per-session pod isolation, SA-token-scoped MCP access, no shared filesystem state, email-allowlist auth that can grow into roles/orgs.

**Why not Anthropic Managed Agents (shipped 2026-04-08)?** Covers most of the env-spec primitives but is (a) Claude-only — breaks the agent-agnostic position, (b) API-billed per-token — breaks the "share my Max subscription with friends" economics, (c) explicitly forbids shipping a Claude-Code-styled UI. Tank-operator's defensible edges are the subscription-token sharing model and the agent-agnostic shape; the runtime layer itself is now commoditized.

## Stack

FastAPI + kubernetes-asyncio backend, Vite + React + xterm.js frontend, multi-stage Dockerfile, Helm chart in `k8s/` synced by ArgoCD. Two namespaces: `tank-operator` (long-lived orchestrator Deployment) and `tank-operator-sessions` (ephemeral session Pods).

## Container build verification

Session pods intentionally do not ship Docker or a container runtime. Do not
report missing local Docker as a blocker. Run available repo checks first
(`pytest`, `npm`, `go test`, `helm template`, etc.). The normal container
build gate is PR CI: `.github/workflows/docker-build-check.yml` performs
throwaway Docker builds for every repo-owned image with `push: false`. If an
image-packaging change needs feedback before a PR is ready, manually dispatch
that workflow with `git_ref`. Release/deploy workflows are the only path that
publishes images.

**Per-user profile store: Cosmos DB (SQL API), serverless** — `infra/cosmos.tf` provisions one account, one database, one `profiles` container partitioned on `/email`. Backend at `backend/src/tank_operator/profiles.py`. Auth is workload identity (the same `claude-credentials-refresher-identity` UAMI that already writes KV); `local_authentication_disabled = true` on the account so there's no key-based parallel surface to rotate. A profile row is auto-created on `/api/auth/microsoft/login` and exposed at `/api/auth/me`. The store boots in degraded "stub" mode if `COSMOS_ENDPOINT` is unset (first-install ordering before tofu has applied) — login still works, profile fields are null.

## Terminal

In-house xterm.js + K8s pods/exec bridge (`backend/src/tank_operator/exec_proxy.py`) with `CLAUDE_CODE_NO_FLICKER=1` set in Claude-mode session pod env to enable Claude Code's alt-screen-buffer renderer (works around the Ink redraw leak in `anthropics/claude-code#49086` and `#29937` — source of the ghost-text and post-resize collision symptoms). The bridge does meaningful work beyond byte-shuffling: bootstrap shell that seeds agent state to skip onboarding prompts (lives in the selected session image at `/opt/tank/bootstrap.sh` per `claude-container/tank-bootstrap.sh` — keeps the apiserver exec URL small), tmux session for reconnect survival, MCP bearer token export from the projected SA token, mode-aware credential setup. Claude, Codex, and Pi sessions use separate SHA-pinned images (`session.image`, `session.codexImage`, and `session.piImage`) built from the same Dockerfile with agent-specific CLIs and support packages baked in, so startup does not fetch skills/extensions at runtime. ttyd-in-pod is a viable alternative — defer until/unless the in-house bridge proves to need protocol features ttyd has and we don't.

**Session pods are multi-container** (`claude` + `mcp-auth-proxy` sidecar). Any `pods/exec` call against them MUST pass `container="claude"` — the apiserver returns 400 "a container name must be specified" otherwise, which surfaces to the browser as a 1006 reconnect loop. Same gotcha for ad-hoc `kubectl exec` debugging: use `-c claude`.

The browser xterm.js terminal is *the* route, not a demo surface. SSH / VS Code Remote attach are not on the roadmap as alternatives. Rendering glitches matter because users can't route around them.

## Auth flow

- Browser SPA uses MSAL.js (auth-code+PKCE) to obtain an Entra ID token from a public app reg (`tank-operator-oauth`, distinct from the CI app). Bootstrap config (`entra_client_id`, authority) comes from the public `/api/config` endpoint.
- SPA POSTs the token to `/api/auth/microsoft/login`. Backend validates via JWKS at `login.microsoftonline.com/common/...` (regex issuer match — permissive; `ALLOWED_EMAIL` env var is the gate), then mints its own HS256 JWT signed with `JWT_SECRET` (7-day TTL).
- Session JWT comes back as response body (frontend → localStorage) and as an httpOnly cookie (`auth_token`). REST uses Bearer; WebSocket uses the cookie since browsers can't set Authorization on WS upgrades.
- `current_user` re-checks the email against `ALLOWED_EMAIL` on every protected endpoint, so revoking access only needs a tofu apply, not a token rotation.
- No oauth2-proxy. Session pods authenticate to in-cluster MCP servers via the projected SA token (read fresh per request by the `mcp-auth-proxy` sidecar in each session pod); MCP servers do Azure work via their dedicated UAMIs.

**GitHub App install flow (#57 stage 2).** When `/api/auth/me` returns `installation_id=null`, the SPA renders an onboarding wall (`frontend/src/App.tsx → OnboardingWall`) instead of the main shell. Clicking the install CTA hits `/api/github/install/url`, which mints a 10-min state JWT (custom audience `tank-operator/github-install`) bound to the caller's email and 302s to `https://github.com/apps/<github.appSlug>/installations/new?state=...`. After GitHub install consent, GitHub redirects to `/api/github/install/callback`; the callback validates *both* the state JWT and the caller's `auth_token` cookie agree on email (defense-in-depth against a phishing flow where an attacker tricks a victim into installing under the attacker's profile), then upserts `installation_id` on the Cosmos profile row and 302s back to `/`. Validation failures redirect to `/?install_error=<reason>` for an SPA banner. The user-facing App lives at `https://github.com/apps/tank-operator-romaine-life` (`tank-operator` slug was taken globally on github.com) — `github.appSlug` in `k8s/values.yaml` carries the actual slug.

## In-cluster MCP servers

The HTTP MCP servers live in standalone repos; this repo keeps only the
runtime identities under `infra/mcp.tf`. Each MCP repo owns its Python source,
image build workflow, and Helm chart with the `kube-rbac-proxy` sidecar.
Inbound auth: claude-session SA token validated via TokenReview +
SubjectAccessReview against the synthetic
`mcp.tank-operator.io/servers/<name>` resource. Currently:

- `nelsong6/mcp-azure-admin` — first-party personal Azure MCP server and chart; runtime naming is `mcp-azure-personal` / `azure-personal`
- `nelsong6/mcp-github` — custom GitHub-App-backed
- `nelsong6/mcp-k8s` — read-only kubectl/helm
- `nelsong6/mcp-argocd` — read-only ArgoCD via Dex SA-token exchange (no static API tokens)

**Two GitHub Apps live alongside each other.** `romaine-life-app` is the host's dev/automation bot — it authors PRs from session pods, runs cluster-side automation, etc. The user-facing App is `tank-operator-romaine-life`, intended for friends to install on their own accounts; its credentials live in KV under `tank-operator-app-*`. Today `mcp-github` reads only romaine-life-app's keys (`GITHUB_APP_*` env via the standalone mcp-github chart's ExternalSecret) and mints every session-pod token from that single installation — multi-user is *configured* (Cosmos profiles, install flow, slug) but not yet *routed*. Stage 3 of #57 is the swap: mcp-github reads `tank-operator-app-*` keys instead, looks up `installation_id` per inbound caller from the Cosmos profile, and falls back to the host's installation (downscoped) when a non-host user touches host-owned repos. Until that lands, session-pod GitHub writes are all attributed to `romaine-life-app[bot]` on host's repos regardless of caller.

### mcp-github write surface: no caller-provided SHAs

Every mutation in `nelsong6/mcp-github/src/mcp_github/tools.py` resolves base refs and blob shas server-side at call time — `create_branch(base="main")`, `create_or_update_file(branch=…)`, `delete_file(branch=…)`, `commit_to_branch(branch=…, base="main", files=…)`. There is intentionally no `from_sha` / `sha` parameter on the public surface. The reason this matters: a prior Claude session reverted a merged PR by branching off a *cached* SHA — it had read `main`'s HEAD early in the session, merged a PR, then made a second PR from the cached pre-merge SHA. The narrow fix (caller still supplies SHA, but tool requires it) doesn't help, because the caller's cache is the bug. The actual fix is to never let the caller supply identifiers for "where am I branching from" or "what version of the file am I overwriting" — the server reads fresh on every call. `commit_to_branch` is the preferred path for any multi-file change because it lands one coherent commit instead of N consecutive `create_or_update_file` calls.

Pair with: prefer the MCP write tools above over `git push` for routine mutations — they resolve refs server-side and dodge the cached-SHA footgun by construction. `mint_clone_token` defaults to a read-only token (`contents: read`); pass `write=True` only when a working-tree push is the right shape (large lockfiles, tool-driven multi-file refactors, anything awkward to enumerate as an explicit `files` array). Push tokens still can't force-push to protected branches — branch protection is the second line of defense, not this scope. The image deliberately doesn't ship a credential helper for `https://github.com`; the inline `x-access-token:<token>@github.com/...` URL form is the only auth path.

### azure-mcp config keys

The `mcr.microsoft.com/azure-sdk/azure-mcp` image binds inbound JWT validation and the OAuth metadata document from **ASP.NET Core hierarchical config keys**, not the `AZURE_AD_*` names some Microsoft Bicep templates use. Source: `microsoft/mcp` repo → `Microsoft.Mcp.Core/src/Areas/Server/Commands/ServiceStartCommand.cs`.

- **Inbound auth + metadata:** `AzureAd__Instance`, `AzureAd__TenantId`, `AzureAd__ClientId`
- **Outgoing OBO calls (DefaultAzureCredential / WorkloadIdentityCredential):** `AZURE_TENANT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` (the resource Entra app's clientID — federation is on the resource app, not a separate MI), `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`, `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`
- `AZURE_MCP_DANGEROUSLY_ENABLE_FORWARDED_HEADERS=true` — required behind any TLS-terminating proxy so the OAuth metadata advertises `https://` resource URLs.
- The image entrypoint is already `./server-binary server start`, so pod `args:` should only contain flags. Default ASP.NET Core bind is `localhost:5000` — set `ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080` (or your port) so kubelet probes and the Service can reach it.
