#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Seed the Claude Code subscription credentials in Azure Key Vault. From there
# ExternalSecret pulls them once into a K8s Secret in the orchestrator
# namespace; the in-cluster api-proxy ext_proc is the only thing that reads or
# writes that Secret going forward. Session pods never see the refresh token.
#
# How to produce the JSON:
#   1. In a Linux env (WSL works on Windows), `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`.
#   2. Run `claude` and complete `/login` in a browser.
#   3. `cat ~/.claude/.credentials.json` — that's the blob this script wants.
#
# When to re-run: only when the refresh chain dies entirely (e.g. you revoked
# access manually, or the gateway has been off long enough that the refresh
# token expired). In normal operation the gateway rotates the refresh token
# in the K8s Secret on every refresh, so KV drifts intentionally — KV is the
# disaster-recovery seed, not the live source of truth.
#
# Usage: scripts/setup-claude-credentials.sh

✓ Credentials seeded. The OAuth gateway will pick up the new refresh token
on its next call to platform.claude.com.

Note: the orchestrator pod caches the refresh token in memory after first
read; restart it (kubectl -n tank-operator rollout restart deploy/tank-operator)
to force an immediate re-read. Existing session pods are unaffected — they
talk to the gateway, not to KV.
